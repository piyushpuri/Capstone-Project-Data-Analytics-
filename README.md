Hi Eduonix,

I am Piyush Puri, share you the thoughts which i had in my mind, during the project, Their is a lot of datasets 
when i see this capstone project. So, after reading the complete Docx. file and all the Questions and
marking scheme then i started my project, i had face many challenges when doing this projects questions,
their are lot of new functions which i had learned doing this project for example (melt functions,
iloc[] function) and how to make the new columns in the existing dataframe with adding the particular
columns value only and doing this operation for each row. Concepts are more clear for making the charts
and all. Overall this project help me alot to learn new things and explore dataset, be more confidence
as Data Analyst.

Thank You so much Eduonix Team.
